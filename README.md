# Express.js and PostgreSQL Project Template

This project template provides a structured setup for building Express.js web applications with PostgreSQL as the database. It includes essential configurations, folder structure, and dependencies to kickstart your project development.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modularized structure to organize different components of your application:

- **assets**: Directory for storing static assets like images, stylesheets, and client-side scripts.
- **controllers**: Contains controller modules responsible for handling business logic and routes.
- **exports**: Placeholder for exported modules and files.
- **helpers**: Utility functions and helper modules.
- **imports**: Placeholder for imported modules and files.
- **locales**: Localization files for internationalization and localization features.
- **logs**: Directory for log files, error logs, and application logs.
- **models**: Database models and schemas using Sequelize ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **views**: Views or templates for rendering HTML using EJS template engine.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies and devDependencies:

- **axios**: HTTP client for making API requests.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords.
- **compression**: Middleware for compressing HTTP responses.
- **cors**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **ejs**: Template engine for rendering HTML views.
- **express**: Web framework for Node.js, used for routing and middleware.
- **express-validator**: Middleware for input validation in Express.js.
- **moment**: Library for handling dates and times.
- **pg**: PostgreSQL client library for Node.js.
- **pg-hstore**: Module for serializing and deserializing JSON data in PostgreSQL.
- **sequelize**: Promise-based ORM for PostgreSQL, used for database interactions.
- **nodemon**: Development dependency for auto-reloading the server during development.

## Configuration

The `config.js` file contains system configuration settings, including application settings and database configurations. Update the configurations as per your project requirements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com//rolky/backend-template.git
   cd express-postgresql-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the database:
   - Update `config.js` with your PostgreSQL database credentials and settings.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8070/` (or the specified port).

## Scripts

- **start**: Start the development server using nodemon for automatic server restarts.
- **test**: Run test suites (tests not included in this template).

## Folder Structure

The folder structure follows a standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern with additional folders for assets, helpers, logs, and configurations.
